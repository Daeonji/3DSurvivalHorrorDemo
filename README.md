## **Overview**

**Submerged: A Silent Descent** is a short survival horror demo developed in **Unreal Engine 5**, inspired by the unsettling atmosphere and slow-burning tension of early *Silent Hill* and *Resident Evil* titles. Set within the claustrophobic confines of a submarine, the game blends retro-style **tank controls**, **fixed camera angles**, and handcrafted visuals to deliver an eerie, immersive experience.

## **Synopsis**

You are a deep-sea diver returning from a mission‚Äîonly to find the crew of your submarine mysteriously gone. The vessel is silent. Damp corridors twist into darkness. Unnatural, flesh-like growths spread across the bulkheads. As you explore, it becomes clear that something is terribly wrong. Alone in the depths, you must uncover what happened‚Ä¶ and survive whatever still lurks below.
